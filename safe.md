== SAFe framework ==

Here are some questions I am asking myself, as well as some comments about:
* SAFe framework, 
* Agile methodologies (especially Scrum) 
* or organization in general

-- all in bulk

* Do things that don't scale (or at least not at first)
  * Shouldn't we stick to essential SAFe ?
    * It is very expensive to use portfolio level SAFe even more if the basics are not consolidated
  * There's still a lot to explore with Kanban/Scrum
* Defines roles, responsabilities and accountability (even for developpment team)
  * Empower people
  * Give legitimacy to people exercising the role of PO / Scrum master
